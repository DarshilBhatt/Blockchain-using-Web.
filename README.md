# Blockchain-using-Web.
I have implemented E-voting system using blockchain on web platform, it saves manpower and electricity. Someone will doubt that E-voting system can be hacked, which is risky. But reality is that, blockchain can never be hacked as it is divided on many computers and servers, it is not run by just single system.
